# ITSperiodicTable
# This project focuses on developing an ITS specifically designed to teach and explain key properties of the first five elements of the periodic table: Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium, Beryllium, and Boron. By narrowing the focus to these elements, the system aims to target foundational Chemistry knowledge, ensuring the content remains accessible and manageable for high school students or beginner learners. The ITS leverages an ontology-based approach to ensure structured and dynamic knowledge representation, coupled with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Tkinter in Python. This combination allows learners to interact with periodic table elements in a way that is both engaging and educational.
# At the core of this ITS is the concept of ontology-driven learning, which provides a formal representation of knowledge and enables structured relationships between elements and their properties. Ontologies have proven effective in domains requiring hierarchical and relational knowledge representation, such as Chemistry education. Using Protégé, the ontology for this project was meticulously designed to include classes such as Element and Group, along with properties like has_Atomic_Number, has_Atomic_Mass, and belongsToGroup. These elements were integrated with the Python-based GUI using Owlready2, a Python library that facilitates querying and interaction with OWL ontologies. This approach ensures that the ITS is not only accurate but also scalable for potential future expansions.
